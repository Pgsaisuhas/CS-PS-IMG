## Image Repository for Problem Statements

This repository is dedicated to storing images that can be linked within problem statements. Since images in Markdown are embedded via public URLs, this repo ensures:

- **Free and publicly accessible image hosting**.
- **Reliable image links** that will render consistently in Markdown files.

This approach provides a straightforward way to include images in problem statements without concerns about broken links or restricted access.
